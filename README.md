<h1> Assignment 2 </h1>
<h3> Security and Logging. </h3>

Dear students, <br />

In this assignment, you are required to create a very simple MVC application using Spring similar to the previous
Assignment. (One entity and CRUD operations on that entity is enough). In the index file, provide necessary links to
nagivate through you web site. You may pick one of the entities from the previous assignment to save up the time.

<h4> Task related: (20%)</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Create a CRUD for a single entity</li>
    <li> Perform a validation for data entry in create and update</li>
    <li> Use DTO pattern instead of exposing your entities to the client</li>
</ul>

<h4> Task related: (20%)</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Enable Spring Security and create simple login page </li>
    <li> You might need to create two default users (one with admin role another with user role) during the application
        startup</li>
    <li> In the above CRUD apply necessary authorization rules so that only ADMIN users can CREATE, DELETE and UPDATE
        the records while any user can list all the records</li>
    <li> Provide logout mechanism from any existing page</li>
</ul>

<h4> Task related: (20%)</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Create a sign-up page. Add links to login and signup pages in the index.</li>
    <li> Users should be able to register themselves (by default with USER role) and login using this user.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Task related: (30%)</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Provide a CRUD for users too (only list, delete, update (only ROLE should be updates) since creating a user
        happens through signup)
    </li>
    <li> Only users with ADMIN role will have access to list, delete and update the role of any users</li>
</ul>

<h4> Task related: (5%)</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Use logging to show info, warning, and errors in the controller actions.
        Note: Use different logging levels for each controller. </li>
    <li> Write a good README file to describe what you have done.</li>
</ul>

<h4> Submission related: (5%)</h4>
<ul>
    <li> Record a short video not exceeding 5 minutes to explain the code
        as well as the way users can interact with the end product
        <ul>Show:
            <li> main blocks of the code base</li>
            <li> each of the features mentioned above</li>
            <li> database after the insertion, updates and removals</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li> Upload the video to YouTube and share the link by adding it to your home page.</li>
    <li> Submissions without a video submission will not be graded.</li>
</ul>

This assignment will give you <strong>10%</strong> of the total. <br />
